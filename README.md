About the Project
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project is a testament of my understanding of complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.
